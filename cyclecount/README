cyclecount
==========
Measures and compares execution time of code snippets at clock cycle level

You need Python 2 to compile, run and clean. 
Gnuplot is optional but handy to display the results and to convert to an image.

To compile all:
./make.py

To compile two tests: "single-example" and "group-example":
./make.py single-example group-example

To run:
./run.py

To run two tests: "single-example" and "group-example":
./run.py single-example group-example

To clean:
./clean.py

After run check the results' directory:
results/single-example/
results/group-example/

If you create a test with name "nothing", its result will be substracted from
the group's results.
