# cyclecount

*Measures and compares execution time of code snippets at clock cycle level*

For example you want to compare execution time of 2 libraries providing the same function. The result will be presented in XML and in a diagram like this*:

Heavily based on code of [Agner Fog](http://www.agner.org/optimize/). Without his excellent work it would have taken ages to write this program.
